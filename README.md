# BYU-Coding-Challenge

This is a coding assesment from BYU. The main objective of the assignment is to create 
a simple full stack application that allows users to view a site and search for movies 
then get data from themoviedb.org and return 10 results.

1. The frontend is created using Vuejs 
2. The backend is created using Nodejs and Express


## Running the Application

You will need to make sure that the frontend and backend are running simultaneously for the application to work properly. 

1. Make sure you have two terminals open 
2. In the first terminal type 'cd .\webservice\' then hit enter. This will change your directory to the folder our backend project is in.
3. Type 'node index.js' then hit enter to start the backend portion of the project
4. In the second terminal type 'cd .\webapp\' and hit enter to get into our frontend directory.
5. Type 'npm run serve' and hit enter to start the project.
6. You can now click on the Local: localhost link that appears in the terminal to see the project 

## IMPORTANT
You will have to change the apiKey in the index.js file to match your personal key given to you from themoviedb.org
